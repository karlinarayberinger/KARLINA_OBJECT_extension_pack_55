<p>As a creator and consumer of art, I sometimes &#8220;worry&#8221; that eventually human civilization will reach a point in time where &#8220;peak creativity&#8221; or, more precisely, &#8220;peak originality&#8221;, (in terms of human-originated ideas and innovations) will be attained and humans will, to some extent, be &#8220;out of ideas&#8221; for how to proceed other than by allowing artificial intelligence to generate content by default or by copying existing art work.</p>
<p>To some extent, I think humans have already entered such an era of &#8220;peak originality&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>(While writing this note directly in the file editor in GitHub (and while burning an M_DISC copy of <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="//karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_24august2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes2025_22</a>), my laptop froze and displayed a plain-text &#8220;image&#8221; of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linux</a> penguin logo and an error message saying that <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_panic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;kernel panic&#8221;</a> has occurred. I think there is something wrong with the hardware of that computer which has caused it to go into that &#8220;kernel panic&#8221; state just by moving the laptop a particular way).</p>
<p>&#8230;Whether or not humans have entered a moment of &#8220;peak originality&#8221;, I think it is still valuable for humans to continue producing art even if it seems relatively unoriginal because the act of producing a piece of art work can be a potent way for humans to explore their own minds (especially content which may be percolating in the subconscious). For me, creating art is often theraputic and makes me feel that I am moving &#8220;junk&#8221; through and possibly out of my nervous system (at a &#8220;software level&#8221;).</p>
