To Whom It May Concern:

I placed an expedited Amazon dot Com order for two ten-disk spindles of 25-gigabyte M_DISC read-only Blu-ray optical disks on 22_JANUARY_2026 with the intention of making the following complete karbytes web-hosted file backup set:

[plain-text]

    Complete karbytes M_DISC snapshot (as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 25_JANUARY_2026)
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    homogeneous    |     disk_quantity x                    | additional details 
    M_DISC layer   |     M_DISC_type                        | (in C-style comments)
    ===============|========================================|=============================================================================================================================
    top_layer:     |     4 x karbytes2026_0_[25jan2026]     |  // represents the portion of karbytes named karbytes_nexus (as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 25_JANUARY_2026).
    ---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    bottom_layer:  |     3 x karbytes2025_22                |  // represents the portion of karbytes named karbytes_origins
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[end plain-text]

I expect to have that snapshot package generated, read-tested, and stowed away in my microwave oven vault within seven days of publishing this note file.

What is particularly significant about this particular planned M_DISC snapshot is that it attempts to capture karbytes as it first becomes what I consider to be as perfect as possible. What I mean by "perfect" is devoid of any functional errors such as broken or incorrectly-pointing hyperlinks, outdated information (especially in files which have been copy-pasted from older files and which retain some outdated features that have been overlooked by me and hence not updated in a timely manner).

I plan on "freezing" the micro-directory which this plain-text note is a part of by 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 25_JANUARY_2026 to ensure that the "perfection" I seek to capture and "set in stone" is maximally protected from "contaminating" influences. 

(Within the past month I suggested that the micro-directory named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_52 serves as a decent "template" for generating future karbytes micro-directories. After finding several errors throughout that micro-directory, I decided that this micro-directory (which is named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_55) is a better exemplar of a karbytes micro-directory template due to the fact that it contains fewer functional errors (and ideally zero of such errors)).

Sincerely,
karbytes
