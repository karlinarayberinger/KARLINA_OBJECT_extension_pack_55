To Whom It May Concern:

After creating a package containing three M_DISC copies of karbytes2025_22 and four M_DISC copies of karbytes_nexus_[24jan2026], I decided to open the next micro-directory of karbytes instead of waiting until after 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 24_JANUARY_2026 to do so.

Yesterday I attempted to implicitly communicate that I would keep the official karbytes file collection frozen between the points in time labeled 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_JANUARY_2026 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 24_JANUARY_2026. The following Uniform Resource Locator points to the web page where I attempted to imply that karbytes would be undergoing that multi-day freeze from being updated:

((*) Note that I titled the “karbytes_nexus” M_DISCs “karbytes_nexus_[24jan2026]” instead of “karbytes_nexus_[23jan2026] like I suggested I would in the aforementioned web page because the first M_DISC I burned which I labeled “karbytes_nexus_[23jan2026]” contained an outdated version of the image file named karbytes_nexus_[20jan2026]_(mdisc_folder_hierarchy).png. After I fixed the incorrect number ordering depicted in that image, I created a few M_DISCs labeled “karbytes_nexus_[24jan2026]” containing that updated image file).

In the past I used to not create M_DISC backups of karbytes as often as I have been this year. (I started creating M_DISC backups of karbytes more frequently after I got a job as a seasonal package handler at a FedEx warehouse (which enabled me to acquire a relatively large amount of money in a relatively short amount of time to purchase more items than what I can currently afford). After that job ended at the end of the peak holiday period, my income stream shrank by approximately $500 per week).

While I am unemployed and on a relatively small income, I plan to buy no more than twenty M_DISCs per week. What I will attempt to do is optimize the process by which I generate packages containing M_DISC backups of karbytes such that I get the most value out of my time, money, and computational resources. Pragmatically speaking, what such optimization will likely entail is the entirety of the official karbytes file collection (and possible “in progress” files which will tentatively be incorporated into the official karbytes file collection at some future point in time) being backed up to karbytes’ USB flash drive for several days before also being burned to an M_DISC (by karbytes). That is how karbytes backed up the official karbytes file collection in the past. Such a method is economical but not as “death ready” as the more lavish alternative mentioned in this note.

Sincerely,
karbytes

(Post Script: I noticed that I made some mistakes in some of the older KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack micro-directories which are part of the collection named karbytes2026_0. In particular, I noticed that I failed to update the template-like text in the preparing_to_make_mdisc_set_on_01january2026 WordPress dot Com web page and accompanying plain-text file and hyper-text-markup-language source code file. Specifically, those karbytes2026_0 files appear to be describing karbytes2026_0 as the one and only folder encompassing the entire karbytes file collection when, in reality, the entire karbytes file collection (as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_JANUARY_2026) spans exactly two folders which are each no larger than 25 gigabytes. The first and oldest of those folders is named karbytes2025_22 and the second and newest of those folders is named karbytes2026_0)).

(Post Post Script: The entire karbytes file collection (as of 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 21_JANUARY_2026) can fit on a minimum of two 25-gigabyte M_DISCs. The first of those discs contains exclusively the data collection named karbytes_origins (and karbytes_origins is essentially identical to the folder named karbytes2025_22). The second of those discs contains exclusively the data collection named karbytes_nexus (and karbytes_nexus is a subset of the folder named karbytes2026_0 (and karbytes_origins is a subset of karbytes2026_0))).
