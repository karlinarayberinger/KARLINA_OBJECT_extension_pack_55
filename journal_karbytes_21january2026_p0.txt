As a creator and consumer of art, I sometimes "worry" that eventually human civilization will reach a point in time where "peak creativity" or, more precisely, "peak originality", (in terms of human-originated ideas and innovations) will be attained and humans will, to some extent, be "out of ideas" for how to proceed other than by allowing artificial intelligence to generate content by default or by copying existing art work.

To some extent, I think humans have already entered such an era of "peak originality"...

(While writing this note directly in the file editor in GitHub (and while burning an M_DISC copy of karbytes2025_22), my laptop froze and displayed a plain-text "image" of the Linux penguin logo and an error message saying that "kernel panic" has occurred. I think there is something wrong with the hardware of that computer which has caused it to go into that "kernel panic" state just by moving the laptop a particular way).

...Whether or not humans have entered a moment of "peak originality", I think it is still valuable for humans to continue producing art even if it seems relatively unoriginal because the act of producing a piece of art work can be a potent way for humans to explore their own minds (especially content which may be percolating in the subconscious). For me, creating art is often theraputic and makes me feel that I am moving "junk" through and possibly out of my nervous system (at a "software level").
